1. **Analyze current driver architecture**
   - **Status**: Complete.
   - Read existing C/C++ sources under `libairspyhf/` and `tools/`.
   - Documented major modules and identified heavy use of `libusb` and pthreads.
   - External dependencies noted: `libusb`, `pthread`, Windows-specific USB code.
   - Still need a deeper look at DSP components and platform differences.

2. **Define Rust project structure**
   - **Status**: Mostly complete.
   - Created a Cargo workspace `rust-migration` containing the `libairspyhf` crate.
   - Exposes a C ABI via `extern "C"` functions (open/close, list devices, open by serial).
   - CLI utilities and examples are not yet ported.

3. **Port functionality module by module**
   - **Status**: Core library implemented.
   - Implemented device open/close using `nusb` with basic unit test.
   - Added linux support for `airspyhf_open_fd` using `nusb::Device::from_fd`.
   - Added `airspyhf_list_devices` and `airspyhf_open_sn` for enumeration.
   - Added helpers `airspyhf_get_output_size`, `airspyhf_is_streaming`,
     `airspyhf_is_low_if` and placeholder `IqBalancer` bindings.
   - Implemented basic setters/getters for samplerate, frequency and
     calibration values.
  - Streaming thread implemented using `std::thread` and nusb bulk
    transfers. Samples are converted and passed to the callback.
    Flash configuration implemented via vendor commands.
   - Added placeholder implementations for attenuation control, bias tee,
     user output pins and board info APIs.
   - Implemented USB vendor command helpers for frequency, samplerate,
     calibration, frontend options and bias tee control.
   - Firmware queries now fetch supported samplerates, architectures,
     attenuation steps and filter gain during device open.
     Frequency tuning mirrors the C implementation including freq_delta.
  - Streaming implemented with a single worker thread using `std::thread` and
    nusb bulk transfers.  The IQ balancer now ports the full FFT based
    algorithm from the C driver using `rustfft` for spectrum analysis.
  - Build now produces an optimized SSE2 DLL via `.cargo/config.toml`.

4. **Documentation and style**
   - **Status**: Docs started.
   - Need comprehensive `///` documentation for public items and inline comments.

5. **Testing and validation**
   - **Status**: Basic unit tests in place.
   - Added tests for `airspyhf_list_devices` and `airspyhf_open_sn`.
   - Must design integration tests that mirror the original driver's behaviour.
   - Property-based tests are planned but not implemented.

6. **Formal verification efforts**
   - **Status**: Exploring tooling.
   - Set up `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt` with warnings denied.
   - Experimenting with `Prusti` and `Creusot` on the DSP code.

7. **Cross-platform build configuration**
   - **Status**: In progress.
   - Ensure `nusb` works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
   - Documented how to build the Rust port on Windows.
   - Provide CMake/pkg-config files for C++ consumers.

8. **Continuous Integration setup**
   - **Status**: Pending.
   - Add GitHub Actions to build and test across platforms and run linting.

9. **Migration guide**
   - **Status**: Pending.
   - Document API differences and provide examples for C++ developers.

10. **Final review and publish**
    - **Status**: Pending.
    - Audit the code, ensure tests pass on all targets, and prepare release tags.

11. **Thread-safety hardening**
   - **Status**: In progress.
   - Introduced AtomicBool for streaming and stop flags.
   - Added mutex-based `param_lock` protecting shared fields.
   - Streaming thread id stored to avoid deadlocks when stopping from callback.
   - convert_samples locked around IQ balancing and freq shift.
   - Added restart/close regression tests.
