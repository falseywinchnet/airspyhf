1. **Analyze current driver architecture**
   - Read existing C/C++ sources under `libairspyhf/` and `tools/`.
   - Document each module's responsibilities, APIs, and dependencies.
   - Record any external dependencies (e.g., libusb, pthreads).
   - Note that the repository does not include the full source for these
     dependencies, which complicates verification efforts and necessitates
     replacing them with Rust-native alternatives.

2. **Define Rust project structure**
   - Create a new Cargo workspace for the library and tools.
   - Provide a `libairspyhf-rs` crate mirroring the C API via `extern "C"`.
   - Provide CLI utilities as separate crates within the workspace.

3. **Port functionality module by module**
   - Translate each C source file to a safe Rust module.
   - Use explicit types and enums to avoid undefined behaviour.
   - For FFI, expose C-compatible interfaces with `#[no_mangle]` and
     `extern "C"` functions.
   - Deny the use of `unsafe` unless absolutely necessary and document each
     occurrence.
   - Replace pthread usage with safe Rust equivalents such as `std::thread`,
     `crossbeam`, or asynchronous runtimes (`tokio`, `async-std`).

4. **Documentation and style**
   - Write comprehensive `///` documentation for every public item.
   - Keep naming conventions close to the original C functions to aid
     understanding for C++ developers.
   - Include extensive inline comments explaining design decisions.

5. **Testing and validation**
   - Reproduce the original driver's unit tests if any; otherwise design new
     tests to cover all APIs.
   - Use `cargo test` for unit and integration tests.
   - Apply property-based testing (`proptest` or `quickcheck`) for robustness.

6. **Formal verification efforts**
   - Run `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt` with `#![deny(warnings)]`.
   - Integrate static analyzers (e.g., `cargo audit`, `cargo udeps`).
   - Explore tools like `Prusti` or `Creusot` to formally verify critical
     algorithms.
   - Ensure all memory safety and concurrency aspects are proven or thoroughly
     tested.

7. **Cross-platform build configuration**
   - Provide USB access using a pure Rust solution. Prefer the `nusb` crate
     for higher reliability, falling back to `rusb` or `yusb` only if necessary.
   - Verify builds on Linux (GNU and MUSL), Windows, and macOS using CI.
   - Ensure `nusb` supports required features on all platforms and contribute
     upstream patches if gaps are found.
   - Document API differences between `libusb` and `nusb` and update the driver
     design accordingly.
   - Offer CMake or pkg-config files so that C++ applications can link against
     the Rust library seamlessly.

8. **Continuous Integration setup**
   - Configure GitHub Actions to build and test on all supported platforms.
   - Run formatting, linting, and test suites on each pull request.
   - Optionally produce release artifacts (static and shared libraries, tools).

9. **Migration guide**
   - Write detailed documentation describing differences between the original
     driver and the Rust implementation.
   - Provide example code snippets for C++ developers demonstrating how to use
     the new library.

10. **Final review and publish**
    - Perform a code audit ensuring every module is documented and tested.
    - Tag a release once parity with the original driver is achieved and
      verification criteria are met.
