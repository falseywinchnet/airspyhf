# Internal notes and questions for the Rust migration

* **nusb evaluation**: The driver skeleton currently relies on the `nusb` crate. I need to verify whether it provides stable support across Linux, Windows, and macOS. If features are missing we may need to patch upstream or fall back to `rusb`.
* **DSP porting**: The C code has several DSP routines such as the IQ balancer. I'm uncertain how best to translate these to idiomatic Rust while maintaining performance. Investigate using `num-complex` and `futures` for streaming.
* **Threading model**: The original driver uses pthreads. We haven't decided whether to use `std::thread` or an async runtime (`tokio`). Need to prototype both approaches.
* **FFI design**: Current interface exposes raw pointers for device handles. Consider a higher-level safe wrapper for internal use while keeping the C ABI stable.
* **Testing strategy**: Only a single open/close test exists. We will need to design integration tests that exercise streaming and error paths, possibly using property-based testing.
* **Verification tools**: Unsure whether `Prusti` or `Creusot` will be practical for the DSP pieces. Evaluate once more Rust code is present.
* **Build system integration**: Eventually the Rust library should produce CMake config files to replace the existing `libairspyhf.pc`. Need to research `cmake-rs` or `pkg-config` helpers.
* **Next steps**: flesh out the device enumeration and streaming functions in Rust, continue documenting the C modules for reference, and set up CI.
* Device enumeration now implemented via `airspyhf_list_devices` and `airspyhf_open_sn`. Need to verify serial string parsing on Windows.
* Basic status helpers (`airspyhf_get_output_size`, `airspyhf_is_low_if`, `airspyhf_is_streaming`) implemented.
* Introduced a minimal `IqBalancer` stub applying simple phase/amplitude correction.
* Added simple setter/getter functions for frequency, samplerate and calibration fields.
* Streaming start/stop now spins up a worker thread using `nusb` bulk
  transfers.  Samples are converted from i16 to floating point and fed
  to the user's callback.  DSP is still simplified but the basic flow
  mirrors the C driver.
* Implemented USB vendor command helpers and wired them into several setter
  functions (VCTCXO calibration, frontend options, attenuation, bias tee,
  AGC/LNA and board info queries).
* Flash configuration write/read implemented via vendor commands.
* Devices opened now load stored calibration on startup.
* Added linux-only support for airspyhf_open_fd using nusb::Device::from_fd.
* Supported samplerates and attenuation steps are now queried from the firmware
  at device open. Filter gain is retrieved as well so DSP scaling matches the
  C driver. Frequency tuning now accounts for firmware-provided frequency delta
  just like the original implementation. Streaming enables the receiver after
  the worker thread starts.
* Added simple DC removal before and after IQ correction. The balancer struct
  now tracks running averages.  Build configuration updated to enable SSE2 and
  fast-math optimizations via `.cargo/config.toml` and release profile switched
  to `opt-level = 3`.  For now we stick with `std::thread` based streaming
  rather than introducing an async runtime.
* Began porting the FFT based IQ balancer algorithm.  The Rust version now
  accumulates samples and performs a very coarse imbalance estimate each time a
  working buffer fills.  The logic is still a placeholder but mirrors the C
  structure so the full algorithm can be implemented later.
* Completed port of the IQ balancer algorithm. compute_corr, utility and imbalance estimation now follow the original C implementation using rustfft and f32 arithmetic.
* Performed a final review of the Rust FFI surface. All API functions from
  `airspyhf.h` are now implemented. Added initial Rustdoc comments for the
  public items and created unit tests covering device enumeration routines.
